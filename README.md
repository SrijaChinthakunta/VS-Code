# VS Code - 🎤 Vocal Studio Code

A revolutionary voice-controlled code editor that transforms speech into Python code in real-time. Built with React and powered by Web Speech API, Vocal Studio Code brings the power of voice recognition to programming.

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice-to-Code Conversion**: Speak programming commands and watch them transform into Python code
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant conversion of voice input to code with no delay
- **Python Syntax Support**: Built-in Python language support with syntax highlighting
- **Terminal Integration**: Built-in terminal for code execution and output display
- **Smart Command Recognition**: Understands natural language programming commands
- **Auto-Processing**: Automatic insertion of generated code into the editor

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Modern web browser with Web Speech API support (Chrome recommended)
- Microphone for voice input

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vocal-studio-code.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vocal-studio-code
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 🗣️ Voice Commands

Vocal Studio Code understands a wide range of programming commands:

### Basic Commands
- **"Create variable x equals 10"** → `x = 10`
- **"Print hello world"** → `print("hello world")`
- **"Define function calculate"** → `def calculate():`
- **"Create list numbers"** → `numbers = []`

### Loop Commands
- **"Run a loop from 1 to 10 and print i"** → `for i in range(1, 11): print(i)`
- **"Loop from 5 to 15"** → `for i in range(5, 16): # loop body`

### Control Flow
- **"If x is greater than 5 then"** → `if x > 5: # code here`
- **"Create if statement condition then"** → `if condition: # code here`

### Data Structures
- **"Create dictionary user"** → `user = {}`
- **"Create array items"** → `items = []`

### Editor Commands
- **"Delete last 2 lines"** → Removes last 2 lines of code
- **"Clear everything"** → Clears all code from editor
- **"Run the code"** → Executes current code in terminal

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Hooks
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor (same engine as VS Code)
- **Voice Recognition**: Web Speech API
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern UI design
- **Build Tool**: Create React App
